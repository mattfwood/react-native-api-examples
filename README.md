# React Native API Examples

Basic [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) API Examples using a project built with [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/).

## Local Setup
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Running `npm start` will open the Expo web interface to help with debugging and launching simulators.

You can also use `npm run ios` and `npm run android` to launch the iOS or Android simulator if available.

## Running On Your Device (Easiest)
In the Expo window that opens in your browser, either click `Send link with emai/SMS...` in the sidebar or download the Expo app ([iOS](https://www.google.com/search?q=expo+app+store&oq=expo+app+store&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i60l3j0.6045j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US)) and take a photo of the QR code to open the app on your phone.
